# Brightness_virus
This is a simple game that will change your PC brightness. This is for an educational purpose (you can also prank people ;p ).

When you run the game called snowcraftgame in the game folder, the game will start and also a minimized cmd file will be initialized.
The minimized cmd file will change the brightness of the computer from max high to min low rapidly.

Basic structure:-
The C++ file will run the bright.cmd and then snowcraft.exe. 
  - snowcraft.exe is the real game.
  - bright.cmd will run a script to minimize the program and change the brightness of the PC.
